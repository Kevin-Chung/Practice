Hackathon notes

features / requirements
  *make groups based on proximity of other people (this should happen with only one person - group leader)
    - use blue tooth to do this, scan and get back UID of phone, query PARSE db to check if UID is with registered app user
    - if it is send initial contact package (just picture name and email maybe- this is for security reasons)
    - generate list view of users in area, show pictures name and email maybe
    - allow user to select multiple users to add in group

  * once group creation happens, contact information should swap automaticlaly
    - show ONE of the group memebers at a time in the contact creation page, allow user to edit information then confirm.
      - REPEAT for all of the potential group members

  * allow for gorup members to request meeting times.
    - one user will request a meeting time. This will broadcast to ALL group members and they will be asked to confirm or deny their attendance. Group members can potentially request 2nd time?
    - allow meeting times to be reoccuring

  * when viewing groups, user should see all group members as list items, and potentially any meeting times that are happening.
    - when user click on any group member, option to view contact information, and delete them from group is shown in popup dialog
    - potentially add block feature?
    - add feature to allow user to text or call, will open up native texting / calling function - NOT a proprietary one.

  * allow user to edit account settings
